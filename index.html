<!-- This is Siddhartha, currently working as Scientist in Indian Space Research Organization. I am part of the payload data management group, where I am involved
in the design and development of software for verification of payload data.<br>
I completed my undergraduate from the Department of Avionics, Indian Institute of Spcae Science and Technology in 2017. I did my BTech Project (undergraduate thesis) with Prof. Deepak Mishra on the use of Deep CNN features for the purpose
of visual object tracking.<br>
On this blog, I would be writing about machine learning stuff that i find interesting. I am particularly interested in the mathematical aspects of ML. I intend to
write about some of the arcane maths commonly found in ML papers in a simplified form.
